# Demand-Driven Marketplace

A NestJS-based marketplace application for household items where buyers post their requirements and sellers bid to fulfill them. The platform supports both pre-owned, new, and refurbished items with a live bidding system.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality

- **Multi-Role User System**: Buyers, Sellers, and Admins
- **Item Requirements**: Buyers post detailed item requirements with budgets
- **Bidding System**: Sellers bid on item requirements with product details
- **Live Bidding**: Real-time bidding sessions with lowest bid selection
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration for booking fees and payments
- **Email Verification**: User registration with email verification tokens

### Business Logic

- **Booking Fees**: 1% or $1 (whichever is maximum) for item requests and bids
- **48-Hour Minimum**: Item requests must be open for at least 48 hours
- **Price Decrease Only**: Bidders can only decrease their bid prices
- **Winner Selection**: Lowest bid wins when bidding session closes
- **Automatic Refunds**: Platform refunds booking fees to non-winning bidders

### Admin Features

- **User Management**: CSV-based user invitations (max 25 per day)
- **Statistics Dashboard**: User counts, active sessions, financial metrics
- **Analytics**: 30-day graphs for requests, sessions, and revenue
